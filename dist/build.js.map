(2010-2013) -- don't bother!\n         *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\n         *\n         * So what to do?  The is the best:\n         *\n         *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\n         *\n         * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\n         * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\n         *\n         *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\n         *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\n         *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\n         *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\n         *\n         * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\n         * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\n         * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\n         * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\n         * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\n         * linear speed or acceleration.\n         *\n         * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\n         *\n         *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\n         *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\n         *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\n         *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\n         *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\n         *\n         *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\n         *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\n         *     pixels!\n         *\n         *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\n         *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\n         *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\n         *\n         * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\n         *\n         *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\n         *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\n         *\n         *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\n         *\n         *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\n         *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\n         *     you know.\n         *\n         * Implementation info:\n         *\n         * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\n         * average mouse:\n         *\n         *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\n         *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n         *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *\n         * On the trackpad:\n         *\n         *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\n         *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n         *\n         * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\n         * also missing delta values.\n         *\n         * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\n         *\n         * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\n         *\n         * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\n         * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.

(2010-2013) -- don't bother!\n         *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\n         *\n         * So what to do?  The is the best:\n         *\n         *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\n         *\n         * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\n         * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\n         *\n         *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\n         *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\n         *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\n         *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\n         *\n         * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\n         * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\n         * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\n         * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\n         * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\n         * linear speed or acceleration.\n         *\n         * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\n         *\n         *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\n         *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\n         *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\n         *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\n         *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\n         *\n         *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\n         *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\n         *     pixels!\n         *\n         *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\n         *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\n         *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\n         *\n         * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\n         *\n         *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\n         *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\n         *\n         *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\n         *\n         *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\n         *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\n         *     you know.\n         *\n         * Implementation info:\n         *\n         * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\n         * average mouse:\n         *\n         *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\n         *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n         *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *\n         * On the trackpad:\n         *\n         *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\n         *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n         *\n         * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\n         * also missing delta values.\n         *\n         * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\n         *\n         * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\n         *\n         * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\n         * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.

create a forum where likeminded individuals could engage each other on a plethora of issues which affect the lives of Guyanese led to the convening of about ten (10) young persons in an informal manner on December 27, 2012. In its early stages, the organization continued to function informally, with members volunteering their time in an ad-hoc manner. Early initiatives included facilitating discussions through unceremonious forums, as well as involvement in social services such as visits to geriatric homes and orphanages. Since then, we have grown and developed into an organization with over two dozen registered members, and scores of annual volunteers for our Signature event, the Cognitive Initiative. </p>\n              <br>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-6\">\n                <img :src=\"require('./static/point-at-benab.jpg')\" alt=\"\">\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n\n        </div>\n      </section>\n\n      <section class=\"section\">\n        <div class=\"container\">\n          <div class=\"level\">\n            <div class=\"level-left\">\n              <div class=\"level-item\">\n                <div class=\"heading\">\n                  <h3 class=\"title is-3\">Team</h3>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"level-right\">\n              <div class=\"level-item\">\n                <a href=\"https://form.jotformz.com/62207581246656\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"button is-link\">Join Now</a>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <hr>\n\n          <!-- Core Team -->\n          <div class=\"columns\">\n              <div class=\"column\">\n                  <figure class=\"image\">\n                    <img :src=\"require('./static/saevion.jpg')\" alt=\"\">\n                  </figure>\n                  <br>\n                  <h4 class=\"title is-4\">Saevion David-Longe</h4>\n                  <!-- <h6 class=\"subtitle is-6\">Role</h6>\n                  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. </p> -->\n              </div>\n\n              <div class=\"column\">\n                  <figure class=\"image\">\n                    <img :src=\"require('./static/larry.jpg')\" alt=\"\">\n                  </figure>\n                  <br>\n                  <h4 class=\"title is-4\">Larry Carryl</h4>\n                  <!-- <h6 class=\"subtitle is-6\">Role</h6>\n                  <p>If it involves reading, researching, or junk food, you can count me in. An engineer by profession, but a youth activist by passion, I try to make whatever little difference I can in the development of young people in Guyana. Being a part of the Benab team allows me to reach a fair number of under-privileged children each year, and try to better prepare them for the new school year. I’m hoping that in time we’ll be able to work together as a team to extend the length of the summer tutoring, as well as expand the range of initiatives that we have.</p> -->\n              </div>\n\n              <div class=\"column\">\n                  <figure class=\"image\">\n                    <img :src=\"require('./static/mkb.jpg')\" alt=\"\">\n                  </figure>\n                  <br>\n                  <h4 class=\"title is-4\">Maryam K Bacchus</h4>\n                  <!-- <h6 class=\"subtitle is-6\">Public Relations Officer</h6> -->\n                  <!-- <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. </p> -->\n              </div>\n\n              <div class=\"column\">\n                  <figure class=\"image\">\n                    <img :src=\"require('./static/benita.jpg')\" alt=\"\">\n                  </figure>\n                  <br>\n                  <h4 class=\"title is-4\">Benita Davis</h4>\n                  <!-- <h6 class=\"subtitle is-6\">role</h6>\n                  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. </p> -->\n              </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <!-- Members -->\n          <!-- <div class=\"columns\">\n            <div class=\"column\">\n                <img src=\"\" alt=\"\">\n                <h4 class=\"title is-4\">Daniella Sobers</h4>\n                <h6 class=\"subtitle is-6\">Role</h6>\n                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
